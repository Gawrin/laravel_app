Laravel File structure and Routing
    When a webpage is refreshed the command used by it is used GET meaning its the basic Routing

    Larvel uses the MVC model 

    
    #File Structuring
        a.) app 
            - http
                -controller: this is where the web pages where the http is located 
                -model: this is where everything about the database is located
        b.) routes
            -api: for middlewares
            -channels: for websockets
            -consoles: this is where we can put in our own artisan commands aside from the built in ones
            -web: this is the one that accepts http, it can also utilize middleware here 
        c.) bootstrap
            -this folder combines the core codes or classes into one not the css bootstrap
        d.) config
            -this is where the app name is located, and other important things like cacheing it could be changed to cookies instead of file
            -also the database can be changed here if needed like mysql, sqlite 
        e.) .env File
            -this also can be used to edit instead of the config
        f.) database
            -here is where we can find the migration
            -php artisan migrate
            -is a good feature it can be used for plug and play
                -seeders: can automatically populate the database
                -factories: has relation with seeders its used together
        g.) public
            -this is the exposed page as the name suggests its public
        h.) resources
            - this is where the css, js, is placed but its rarely used as public is usually the one edited
        i.) views
            - when route runs it returns a view. 
        j.) storage
            -storage

    #Routing
        -we need to know to structure routes properly to prevent problems
        - this is wher we dictate how the user access the pages so it is very importatn
